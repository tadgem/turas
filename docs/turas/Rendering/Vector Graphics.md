Vector graphics will be a renderer rather than coded through script. e.g. we will have components ala a mesh in the [[Scene]] that will contribute to the rendering of 2d images. 

a [[View]] can therefore add a VG [[Pipeline]] component which will inspect the scene for all VG components and render them accordingly.

N.B. how do we handle things like HUD elements for multiple players within different views?
