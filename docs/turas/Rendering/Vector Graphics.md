Vector graphics will be a renderer rather than coded through script. e.g. we will have components ala a mesh in the scene that will contribute to the rendering of 2d images. 

a view can therefore add a VG pipeline component which will inspect the scene for all VG components and render them accordingly.


N.B. how do we handle things like HUD elements for multiple players within different views?
